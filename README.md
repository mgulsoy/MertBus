MertBus Transport Protocol Libraries

This set of libraries provides transport layer to communication mechanisms built on top of rs485 physical structure. There are 2 sets of libraries currently. One for arduino and one for .net .

This library **only** provides transport layer. This very first version does not block network collusions so developers (if they want to use this library) should design their protocols according to this. 

Please check the wiki pages for further information.

This library is based on NON OF ANY STANDARTS and still in development. I do not give any guarantee to work. If you use the code here the responsibility is yours! It may look like ModBus but it is not!
